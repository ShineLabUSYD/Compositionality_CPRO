# Compositional Recombination Relies on a Distributed Cortico-Cerebellar Network
This repository contains the code used in my project *"Compositional Recombination Relies on a Distributed Cortico-Cerebellar Network"* . 

**Code** was written using a combination of MATLAB and Python scripts.

**Data** was downloaded from *OpenNeuro* [ds003701]([https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002105/versions/1.1.0](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003701/versions/1.0.1)) and originally collected from this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01000-w).
## code
The code folder contains the code required to run the analyses and produce the figures. The following scripts will be described in an order that fits with the manuscript and analyses. Note that these scripts are not functions and should be viewed similar to a notebook.
